<p>Ipanema Beach in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil beacuse  The city's as sizzling as its sexy locals, and this renowned party beach is your chance to totally not stare at them from behind your aviators.</p>
<p> Anse Source d’Argent in La Digue, Republic of Seychelles because  Its towering cliffs and pink sand make it one of the most photographed beaches in the world. </p>
<p>Hidden Beach in  The Marieta Islands by Puerto Vallarta, Mexico because this beach is rumored to have been formed by the Mexican military detonating test bombs in the early 1900s.</p>
<p>Plage de St. Jean in St. Barths, French Caribbean because Located at the end of the island's airport (which claims to have one of the world's shortest landing strips at 2,100 feet), this beautiful beach comes with an air of danger; in 2009, a plane ran out of runway and crashed on it. Thankfully, no one was injured. </p>
<p>7 Mile Beach in Negril, Jamaica because Flanked by epic cliffs, it's one of the longest and most beautiful beaches in the world. Although, it's actually only SIX miles long, just so you know.</p>

<h3 #1 BEACH IN THE WORLD...</h3>

<p>Baia do Sancho-in Fernando de Noronha, Brazil I mean...it´s been voted the most beautiful beach in the world for the 2nd year in a row. What else could you expect from a place with such reputation? I imagine heaven must look similar to Sancho. Keep in mind that access isn't easy, but it´s worth every struggle. If you have any motion restraints...you should think twice though.</p>
